#### Changes for seasons 2:
* PTP contributors respond to each other instead of only writing their own article?
* Have to submit 2 weeks before the month ends?

Possible paths Kitty wants to pursue:

# 1. Comic: On meta-conversation
(Conversations about conversation.)

A short comic strip that converse about conversations: contrast how conversations "normally go" and how a shift in language can lead to a more wholesome, joyous and loving conversation, thus, more collaborative story and relationships.

* Shift our dialogue ontology to love instead of fear.
* Maybe explore: 	
	* Buddhist texts (and where Buddhism failed?)
	* Integral Theory by Ken Wilber: Levels of Consciousness
	* Methods that has worked for trauma treatment (EMDR, yoga, neurofeedback) 

I find many commonalities between decolonial activism and empathy-based conversations. The 2 fields, decolonial studies (for example, Critical Race Theory, which talks about society as a whole) and the private sphere of conversations overlap. But there is no language for them yet. Thus, activism is not used in daily life wisdom and vice versa. But as I mentioned in [What's Love* Got To Do With Intimacy?](https://ptp.voyage/journal/12/#whatslovegottodowithit):

> revolutionary actions must reconstitute our social relations in ways that are different from the domination in which we oppose

### Question:
* Should I document existing rituals, or real-life conversation, or fictional dialogue?
* Can I make the comic strip (in pictures), then Shotaro and Haruma respond to it (in words or pictures) through theories or reflections?

# 2. Photography: How space creates intimacy

Explore the relationship between space and community (the feeling of coziness, being home, or creativity) by writing about a community space each month and do fieldwork analysis.

* The feeling of intimacy creates a human environment for individuals within it to be themselves and self-actualize.
* Show the interplay of architect/design with emotional sphere/experience.
* Maybe explore:
	* Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander
* Possible examples:
	* [NÃ©m Space](https://www.instagram.com/nem.space/)
	* [Mat Nagoya](https://www.mat-nagoya.jp/)

### Question:
* Should I explore local examples? Or big, notable examples?
* What is the metric for an "intimate space"? Perhaps we can have a metric after 12 articles?But where shall I start with right now?
* Explore public spaces (park, street, cafe, studio). How about private spaces like kitchen, homes?

----
Possible: 
### Make installation on intimacy with artists

Frequency: Every 3 months.
Make something physical with a local artist that creates a small prototype for intimate space.
	* This is a tool that enable triangulation connection (like busking).
	* Has a prototype: Easy to replicate anywhere in the world.

### A "date" with PTP contributors

Frequency: Every 3 months.
Meta-conversation with PTP contributor to explore each other's ontologies.
